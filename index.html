      <h4>Welcome to my corner of the Internet.</h4>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer based in Seattle.
        I build developer tools at Microsoft for other nerds like me.
        I was raised in New England and
        graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in computer science and a minor in business.
        In my spare time, I like to hike around the PNW, read historical fiction,
        sample local brews, and explore new music via NPR Tiny Desk concerts.
